= discreet_proxy

Writes and reads Flame/Smoke proxy files (.p) using ChunkyPNG.

To read every .p file on your Flame system and write it out as a PNG preview to the /tmp

  Dir.glob("/usr/discreet/project/**/*.p").each do | icon_path |
    proxy = DiscreetProxy.from_file(icon_path)
    dest_path = "/tmp/" + File.basename(icon_path) + ".png"
    proxy.save_png(icon_path)
  end
  
Also you can use the builtin `flame_proxy_icon` binary to convert to and from the format.

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
